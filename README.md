Iâ€™m a Software Engineer, specialised in Frontend technologies, who turned more than 300 junior developers into great programmers. Nice to meet you!

Having experience teaching has afforded me the opportunity to develop three key skills: debugging errors in complex code, developing granular and in-depth knowledge of multiple technologies, and effectively training junior team members by explaining complex concepts in simpler terms.

My experience at Free Now was a pivotal step that allowed me to go the extra mile in my career. Working alongside highly skilled professionals, I was able to learn best practices and dive deeper into the world of architectural patterns.

I was committed to delivering user-tailored features designed focusing on performance and measurability. Additionally, I had the opportunity to lead the front-end horizontal, coordinating initiatives in the chapter, engaging members as well as external individuals organising tech talk events.

I'm very confident with testing my code, mostly choosing a TDD approach, which greatly increases my development speed. I try to leave every bit of code I touch more readable, modular, performant, and accessible than I found it.

I'm passionate about continuously improving my knowledge, I'm a fast learner who can find
creative solutions to technical challenges. As I had to follow juniors in their projects I often
functioned as the Team Leader giving directions and managing their skills to bring out the best in each of them.
